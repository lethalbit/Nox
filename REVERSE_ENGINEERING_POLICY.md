# Nox Reverse-engineering Policy

It is important to ensure that all source code and documentation contributions to Nox, as well as everything else produced by the project is on good legal standing and free of any possible copyright violations and potential legal problems. As such, in order to ensure this, the following policy has been put into place.

While clean-room reverse-engineering is the ideal process, in which a pure specification is produced by an isolated team which is then implemented by developers, it is not easy to maintain such an effort with a small team of volunteers for an open source project. Therefore, while it is the ideal state, a pure clean-room reverse-engineering process is not required for Nox as it's not sustainable.

As such, only trusted contributors can omit the full clean-room process, if you are wanting to contribute with reverse engineering, you must do so in a clean-room manner, and produce a specification for another member of the team to implement.
