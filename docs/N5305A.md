# N5305A Notes

The following notes discuss the process of N5305A module boot up, configuration, programming, and analyses connection as seen from over the network.

## N5305A Initial Configuration

It seems like the N5305A, and all other modules for the N5540A want to have an DHCP daemon on `10.0.0.1/8` with `BOOTP` support. They also expect an FTP daemon on this same port to serve the files for module initialization and gateware.

There are also some services running on some TCP and UDP ports on the controller which look to be orchestration and control.
