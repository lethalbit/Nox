# Nox GUI design guidelines

The design language for the Nox GUI must follow the rules specified by the [KDE Human Interface Guidelines](https://hig.kde.org/). 

While it is not a dedicated KDE application, and is planned to be supported on multiple platforms with multiple desktop environments, after reviewing the HIG documents that are out there, the KDE guidelines best match what is trying to be accomplished with the Nox GUI.

However, due to this fact that Nox GUI is planned to be run on such a wide range of platforms and environments some small alterations have been made.

Unless otherwise noted in this document, the rest of the KDE HIG apply.
